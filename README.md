# Perceptron from Scratch

This repository contains a simple implementation of a perceptron using Python and NumPy. The perceptron is a basic building block of neural networks and demonstrates how neural networks learn through weight adjustments based on input data and corresponding outputs.

## Features

- Uses sigmoid activation function
- Logistic function for output
- 3 neurons in the input layer
- Trains on a simple dataset

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
